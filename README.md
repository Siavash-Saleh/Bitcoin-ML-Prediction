# Bitcoin-ML-Prediction
BTC price trend analysis and prediction using machine learning.
## Project Overview:

This project applies Machine Learning (Linear Regression) to analyze Bitcoin price trends. The goal is to build a predictive model based on historical BTC price data to understand trends and potential future movements.

### Dataset & Preprocessing:

Data Source: BTCUSDT_H1.csv (Hourly Bitcoin price data)

### Preprocessing Steps:

Converted text-based numerical values into float format.

Handled missing values by removing incomplete records.

Selected relevant features for model training.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation.

### Machine Learning Model:

Algorithm: Linear Regression

### Implementation Steps:

Defined independent variables (features) and the target variable (BTC Close price).

Trained the model using the training dataset.

Evaluated performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Saved the trained model for future predictions.

### Results & Insights:

The model provides insights into Bitcoin price trends based on historical data.

R^2 Squared was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy.
